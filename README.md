# Coding-Exercises-Solutions-Explanations-Austin-McTier

Coding Exercise Solutions, Code, Explanations, Figures, and other files, for the purpose of submitting for the Quant Specialist Position at FRBA.

Hello, my name is Austin McTier, and this is the README file for this repository, where I have submitted my necessary output for the Coding Exercises, assigned to me for the purpose of advancing my application for the Quant Specialist Position at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

The files submitted include my code, done in R / RStudio with the exception of the code provided in the txt file (for problem #3), which was done in Python 3.11. My solutions are primarily found in the word document "Coding_Exercise_Solutions," though I do include notes in my R code pertaining to my solutions.

I have also attached figures, charts, and other output that pertain to my solutions. These can be found in the word document, but have been posted as separate files just in case.

Thank you very much again, and I am able to be contacted at austin.mctier@atl.frb.org or (478)960-6663 if I missed anything, or if there are any further updates.
